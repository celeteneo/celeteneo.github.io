# Responsible Routes
Project for Virtual Global Hackathon 2023

“Responsible Routes” is an application designed to reduce traffic jams by building the most efficient routes; preserve the environment by reducing exhaust emissions; organize flexible and convenient bus routes; and increase the amount of affordable transport for people with low incomes.

## Usage
Custom routes can be added by pushing road object to 'roads' variable
```javascript
let roads = [
    {start: {x: startPointX, y: startPointy}, end: {x: endPointX, y: endPointY}},
    ...
]
```
